    <h3>EDA Reflection</h3>
    <h5>March 21, 2016</h5>
    
    <p>Initially I was terrified coming into EDA as I have no experience what so ever with writing code and majority of the programmes are new to me. The concepts of learning code through EDA are more suitable for me as it is far more engaging as opposed to university lectures. </p>

    <p>My first impression about EDA make me nervous as I was constantly told that this will push you and test you mentally. In one word, hard, is what kept going through my head. </p>

    <p>From my perspective, the culture of EDA is very supportive yet everyone strives to do the best they can do as well as being able to help others. Being able to have option of repeating three weeks is a good idea but as for people that are advanced with code I was puzzled whether it is not good for them to help the people that are not as advanced.</p>

    <p>No my expectations have no changed but altered slightly, yes this is going to be hard and very mentally challenging but if you put in the work you will get the results you hope for. I am both excited and nervous at the same time. Let the journey begin!</p>
